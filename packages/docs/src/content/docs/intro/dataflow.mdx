This tutorial covers more details and ways data flows in and out of pardon
templates.

The material assumes familiarity with concepts introduced in collections (and templates).

<CollectionLinkCard href="/intro/collections" />

## Data matching

In the collections tutorial we introduced product `get`, `update`, and `delete`
endpoints that required a `{{product}}` identifier.  We will update
the create products call to tell Pardon (and future consumers of
this collection), where these identifiers come from.

The `example/products/create` endpoint returns newly created products.
Let's define a response template with `"id": "{{products}}"` to
bind the value in the response.

```http title="example/products/create.https" ins={9-14}
>>>
POST https://example.com/products
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "{{name}}"
}

<<<
200 OK

{
  "id": "{{product}}"
}
```

Response templates help pardon help you help your scripts interpret the request.

:::note
Request and mixin https files can have multiple request and response templates:
The _first matching request_ and the _first **subsequent** matching_ response
_in the endpoint and each mixin_ are what pardon uses.
:::

To see this in action, please can create three products in our system.

Two new features are available in this tutorial:
  1. making requests
  2. a data view of the values resolved from the request or response

:::tip
As we run these new exercises, you can track the products via the
counter in the lower right of the screen.

You can reset the system with the reset button there too.
:::

<PardonPlayground response data example={`
  POST https://example.com/products

  {
    "name": "pencils",
    "price": 2
  }
`} config={serviceAndPingAndProductsWithConfigurableAuth}>
  <Exercises>
    <ExerciseItem label='add pencils'
          prompt="Add pencils to the product system.">
       Post the current request with this button.

       Confirm the product count went up by one.  See that the `id` is identified
       by `"product"` in the response as well.
    </ExerciseItem>
    <ExerciseItem label='add pens'
          prompt="Add pens to the product system.">
      Replace the input/ask with this and use the same
      button to reset the control back to request mode.
    <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins=/"pens"/ ins="3"
POST https://example.com/products

{
  "name": "pens",
  "price": 3
}
```
      </IconicCode>
    </ExerciseItem>
    <ExerciseItem label='Add markers'
          prompt="Add markers to the product system.">
      <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins=/"markers"/ ins="5"
POST https://example.com/products

{
  "name": "markers",
  "price": 5
}
```
      </IconicCode>
    </ExerciseItem>
  </Exercises>
</PardonPlayground>

### Data Conflicts

Values can be resolved by template matching on the input request,
or provided by inputs and evaluated in expressions.  We have also
shown how values can override the input in the case of `config` alternatives
(like `env=stage` and `env=prod` overriding the endpoint origin).

Before we introduce structured data and scopes, we just tneed to see
that values can conflict if they are specified to two values.

<PardonPlayground values="name=abc" example={`
  POST https://example.com/products

  {
    "name": "abc"
  }
`} config={serviceAndPingAndProductsWithConfigurableAuth}>

Try changing the value of name in either the values or the input request here.
See how pardon becomes confused
(<span class="inline-icon"><SolidIcon name="confused"/></span>) if it can't decided what the value is.

</PardonPlayground>

## Data Scopes

Not all requests have such simple `key=value` data.  Now that we have products,
we'll want to let customers order them, and an order generally has a list.

```http title="example/orders/create.https"
>>>
POST https://example.com/orders

{
  cart: [{
    "id": "{{product}}",
    "quantity": number("{{quantity=1}}")
  }]
}
```

Pardon interprets a single element array as a template for each item,
and then evaluates each item in its own scope.  Let's see how this works here

<PardonPlayground values example={`
  POST https://example.com/orders

  {
    "cart": [
      { "product": "P1001" }
    ]
  }
`} config={serviceWithOrdering}>
<Exercises>
<ExerciseItem label="Add an item" prompt="Add a cart item">

Add another item to the list. Notice how the default quantity of 1
is supplied for both.

  <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins="," ins={6}
POST https://example.com/orders

{
  "cart": [
    { "product": "P1001" },
    { "product": "P1002" }
  ]
}
```
  </IconicCode>
</ExerciseItem>
<ExerciseItem label="Globals" prompt="Override the default quantity">
  We can override the default quantity via values.
  <IconicCode name="setting">
```http ins=/.*/
quantity=7
```
  </IconicCode>
</ExerciseItem>
<ExerciseItem label="Locals" prompt="Override a specific item quantity">
  We can override the quantity for a specific item in the template
  <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins=/, "quantity": 3/
POST https://example.com/orders

{
  "cart": [
    { "product": "P1001", "quantity": 3 },
    { "product": "P1002" }
  ]
}
```
  </IconicCode>
</ExerciseItem>
<ExerciseItem label="Scoped Compute"
  prompt="">
  We can use a values in the local scope (or parent scopes).
  Try setting the quantity to a computation (last digit for the product id)
  <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins={6-9} "2"
POST https://example.com/orders

{
  "cart": [
    { "product": "P1001", "quantity": 3 },
    {
      "product": "P1002",
      "quantity": "{{= Number(product.slice(-1))}}"
    }
  ]
}
```
  </IconicCode>
  and then try modifying that digit, while keeping an eye on the output.
</ExerciseItem>
</Exercises>
</PardonPlayground>

### Structured Values

You might have noticed that we turned off the values output view for the previous
exercise,... that's because nothing shows up there for scoped values.

To fix this, we can specify export names for interfacing values with our templates.

This means replacing `{{product}}` with `{{items.product}}` and 
`{{quantity}}` with `{{items.quantity}}` to specify `items` as the export
name for the scoped values.

<PardonPlayground values editor="example/orders/create.https" data example={`
  POST https://example.com/orders

  {
    "cart": [
      { "product": "P1001", "quantity": 7 },
      { "product": "P1002", "quantity": 42 }
    ]
  }
`} config={serviceWithOrdering}>

<Exercises>
  <ExerciseItem label="Bind exports"
    prompt="Bind scoped data to export values">

Use the editor (<span class="inline-icon"><SolidIcon name="code"/></span>) to bind export values to `items`, notice the
`items` array appears in the data output.

<IconicCode name="editor" titled>
```http title="example/orders/create.https" ins="items."
>>>
POST https://example.com/orders

{
  cart: [{
    "product": "{{items.product}}",
    "quantity": number("{{items.quantity=1}}")
  }]
}
```
</IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="Pass exports"
    prompt="Pass exports as input">
Pardon supports passing the values entirely in terms of
the `items[]` data.  This can be useful when translating
data in one format to another.

First we delete the cart from the request
<IconicCode name="setting">
```http del={2-8}
POST https://example.com/orders

{
  "cart": [
    { "product": "P1001", "quantity": 7 },
    { "product": "P1002", "quantity": 42 }
  ]
}
```
</IconicCode>

And then we pass these values.  Now the request, for better
or worse, can be specified without any template matching on the body. 
<IconicCode name="setting">
```json ins={1-4}
items=[
  { product: "P1001", quantity: 7 },
  { product: "P1002", quantity: 42 }
]
```
</IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
  {/*
  <ExerciseItem label="Rescoping">
    As it turns out, `items=[{ product: "P1001", quantity: 7 }, { product: "P1002", quantity: 42 }]`
    is rather long... if we don't care about the order of the items
    so much, we might want to specify our items as a map.
<IconicCode name='setting'>
```
items={
  "P1001": { quantity: 7 },
  "P1002": { quantity: 42 }
}
```
</IconicCode>
We can do that with the `keyed` template transformer, which 
matches the `product` field into the `{{key}}` value and scopes
the items as if it were a map.
<IconicCode name="editor" titled>
```http title="example/orders/create.https" ins=/keyed[(].*, / ins=/(?<=}])[)]/ ins="@key"
>>>
POST https://example.com/orders

{
  cart: keyed({ "product": "{{key}}" }, [{
    "product": "{{items.@key}}",
    "quantity": number("{{items.quantity=1}}")
  }])
}
```
Please try experimenting with how this matches the original request
body and how it renders our input.
</IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="Rescoping 2">
    Quantity was repeated in our previous example, likely
    in an order flow we would have more than one attribute for
    items, but ... we could get away with even more?
<IconicCode name='setting'>
```
items={ P1001: 7, P1002: 42 }
```
</IconicCode>
We can do that with the `@value` references.
<IconicCode name="editor" titled>
```http title="example/orders/create.https" ins="items."
>>>
POST https://example.com/orders ins="@value"

{
  cart: keyed({ "product": "{{key}}" }, [{
    "product": "{{items.@key}}",
    "quantity": number("{{items.@value=1}}")
  }])
}
```
Please try experimenting with how this matches the original request
body and how it renders our input.
</IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
  */}
</Exercises>
</PardonPlayground>

### Arrays, Mix/Mux and Keyed-scopes

One of the major structural challenges with Pardon is understanding lists/arrays,
because there's not always lists, are they?

In the previous `example/orders` example, the order of the items is less important
than the association of the quantity with the product, i.e., 
logically we would probably want to merge quantity 
into the element based on the `id` field.

<FlexyCodeGrid>
```json
[
  { id: "P1001" },
  { id: "P1002" }
]
```
```json
[{
  id: "P1002",
  quantity: 7
}]
```
<Icon name="right-arrow" class="place-self-center grow-0"/>
```json
[
  { id: "P1001" },
  { id: "P1002", quantity: 7 }
]
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>

Some less desirable alternative behaviors are
 - failing to match because the ids differ in the first element, or
 - failing to match because the array lengths differ, or
 - appending a third element.

(We will see how to achieve the desired behavior later.)

Pardon achieves some of these behaviors through different modes
when interpreting templates.  The mode we have been using for
collection templates has been `mix`, which is for specifying
a schema-like-structure, and the mode we use for
the request input template is `mux`, which is for templated data.

The primary difference between `mix` and `mux` modes is how they handle 
arrays.

#### `mix` mode arrays
In `mix` mode, a non-singular array is treated as a tuple.
This could be useful when the position of the items is important,
as well as the number, such as `{ "point": ["{{x}}", "{{y}}", "{{z}}"] }`.
In this case `x`, `y` and `z` are _not_ scoped as array items.

A singular array, on the other hand, is treated as a template for all
items, and template values referenced in it are scoped to the item (they
will _read_ from the outer scope but not resolve into it).

#### `mux` mode arrays
A `mux` mode array is that length, whatever it is.
If the template is being applied on top of an existing array field,
then the behavior is dependent on the base.  If the base specified a tuple,
the array must match the length of the tuple and the fields will merge pair-wise.
If the base is a singular array (a template for all items), then the template
will be merged with each item.

We saw this merging with `{{quantity = 1}}` applying to all items 
in our ordering example.

#### `keyed` arrays

`keyed` is not a mode, it is an additional layer of structure
that treats the array as a map based on a resolved key.  (And it is our
key to achivieving the desired behavior we referenced earlier)

To make an array `keyed` we specify a template for how to resolve the
key along with the array. e.g., for the `example/products/list` endpoint
we could specify a `keyed` interpretation.

```http ins=/keyed.*, / ins=/(?<=}])[)]/
keyed({ id: "{{key}}" }, [{
  id: "{{product}}",
  name: "{{name}}",
  price: "{{price}}"
}])
```

{/*
TODO: explore ts-morph-supported alternative syntaxes like

[{
  "name": "{{name}}",
  "price": "{{price}}"
}].keyed({ "id": "{{key}}" })

or even

[...{ "id": "{{key}}" }, {
  "name": "{{name}}",
  "price": "{{price}}"
}]

alternatively

[{ "id": "{{key}}" }, ...{
  "name": "{{name}}",
  "price": "{{price}}"
}]

or perhaps

{ "id": "{{key}}", ...[{
  "name": "{{name}}",
  "price": "{{price}}"
}]}
*/}

This makes pardon internally treat this array as a map
```
{
  "P1001": { "id": "P1001", "name": "pencils", "price": 2 },
  "P1002": { "id": "P1002", "name": "pens", "price": 3 }
}
```

so now another array like `[{ "id": "P1003", "name": "markers" }]`
is clearly a new element based on the `id`.

This mapping also affects export scopes. 

<PardonPlayground response data editor="example/products/list.https" example={`
  GET https://example.com/products
`}  config={serviceWithOrdering}>
<Exercises>
  <ExerciseItem label="match response"
    prompt="create a response template">
First let's create a response template that exports the items as
an array.
<IconicCode name="setting" titled>
```http title="example/products/list.https" ins={3-12}
>>>
GET https://example.com/products

<<<
200 OK

[{
  "id": "{{items.product}}",
  "name": "{{items.name}}",
  "price": "{{items.price}}"
}]
```
</IconicCode>

Copy this to the request template and then execute the request to see
how the response data (<span class="inline-icon"><SolidIcon name="eye"/></span>) changes
:::note
you'll need to have some products created first
:::

  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="keyed response"
    prompt="use keyed on the response to get a map">

    Now let's remove the `{{items.product}}` value and move that to
    an object key.
<IconicCode name="setting" titled>
```http title="example/products/list.https" ins=/keyed.*, / ins=/(?<=}])[)]/
>>>
GET https://example.com/products

<<<
200 OK

keyed({ "id": "{{key}}" }, [{
  "name": "{{items.name}}",
  "price": "{{items.price}}"
}])
```
</IconicCode>

Copy this to the request template and the response data (if it's still shown)
it will update immediately.
    </ExerciseItem>
    <ExerciseItem label="super-keyed response"
    prompt="use @value and multiple outputs">

    Explore changing `items.name` to `names.@value` and `items.price` to `prices.@value`, this
    declares data exports of direct values in maps (rather than a map of objects).

    See how the data output (<span class="inline-icon"><SolidIcon name="eye"/></span>) changes.

    (is this wise in this case? <span class="inline-icon"><SolidIcon name="shrug"/></span>?)
<IconicCode name="setting" titled>
```http title="example/products/list.https" ins=/names[.]@value/ ins=/prices[.]@value/

  "price": "{{price.@value}}"
}])
```

  </Exercises>
</PardonPlayground>

#### Multi-value `keyed` arrays

Unfortunately (for me), one more variant of keyed arrays is commonplace.
This is the where there's more than one element for the same key.
The internal representation is a map to a list, but the way Pardon
handles this structure is a bit different.

You might think this is a little crazy, but query parameters and headers are both
commonly represented as structures.

By _default_ query parameters (technically called the `search` portion of
a request URL) is handled as a simple map, but we can turn on multi-map functionality.

Let's do that here,... just to get a feel for things.

<PardonPlayground editor="example/ping.https" example={`
  GET https://example.com/ping
`} config={serviceAndPingAndProducts}>
<Exercises>
  <ExerciseItem label="two params"
    prompt="add two query params on the same key">
Let's update the request with two query params, with the same key
<IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins=/[?].*/
GET https://example.com/ping?hello=world&hello=earth
```
</IconicCode>
notice that only the last one is produced.
  </ExerciseItem>
    <ExerciseItem label="search: multi"
      prompt="allow multiple query params for the same">
  Update the endpoint with `search: multi` to enable 
  multiple query param handling.
<IconicCode name="code" titled>
```http title="example/ping.https" ins=/search: multi/
search: multi
>>>
GET https://example.com/ping
```
</IconicCode>

Try this again
<IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins=/[?].*/
GET https://example.com/ping?hello=world&hello=earth
```
</IconicCode>
and now both parameters are produced.
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="search: multi - merging"
      prompt="include parameters in the tempalte">

Include one or more query params in the base template
<IconicCode name="code" titled>
```http title="example/ping.https" ins=/[?].*/
search: multi
>>>
GET https://example.com/ping?hello=world
```
</IconicCode>

And try this again
<IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins=/[?].*/
GET https://example.com/ping?hello=world&hello=earth
```
</IconicCode>

Also try another value, like
<IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins=/venus/
GET https://example.com/ping?hello=venus&hello=earth
```
</IconicCode>
Or you can use a template and see how that merges
(it merges with the first one).
<IconicCode name="editor" titled>
```http title="example/ping.https" ins=/[?].*/
search: multi
>>>
GET https://example.com/ping?hello={{?greeting}}
```
</IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
</Exercises>
</PardonPlayground>

## Next Steps

Alright! That's _an _introduction on dataflow.  We see there's many
ways to organize collections and conform request and response
processing to match the data structures that suit them.

The next section will be on integrating scripts, and then
we'll cover testcases, followed by project layering / organization and sharing.
