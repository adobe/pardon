This tutorial expands on Pardon scripting.
Defining scripts and importing them into collections,
as well as exporting them.

The exercies here requires that some products are created,
if you haven't created any, you can follow the Steps
in the first exercise in the dataflow tutorial to make a few.

<CollectionLinkCard href="/intro/dataflow" />

## Scripts

Pardon scripts are javascript/typescript ECMA script modules (`esm` / `esmodule`).
Consider our example service, we'll be adding an example-helper.ts support script.

<FileTree>
- example/
  - service.yaml
  - **example-helper.ts**
  - products/
    - list.https
    - ...
</FileTree>

We'll have this script provide a "serviceToken", using a slow connection to an
authorization server with a timeout: and we are also appending a time-based value so
we can see the result changing.

```ts title="example/example-helper.ts"
export async function serviceToken(env: string) {
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 700));

  return `service-token-${env}-${`${Date.now()}`.slice(-5)}`
}
```

To use this script from an template expression, we'll use `export` and `import`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="export">
In order to import from 'pardon:example', as in
```ts
import { serviceToken } from 'pardon:example';
```
we need to define what the `example` collection exports.
This is one line in the `service.yaml`:

```http title="example/service.yaml" ins={1}
export: ./example-helper.ts
config:
  origin:
    env:
      prod: https://example.com
      stage: https://stage.example.com
mixin:
  - pardon:example/auth.mix.https
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="import">
Then we can import named values from the 
```http title="example/auth.mix.https" ins={1-3} ins="serviceToken(env)"
import:
  pardon:example:
    - serviceToken
config:
  authorization: token
>>>
ANY //
Authorization: {{ @auth = serviceToken(env) }}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<PardonPlayground values secrets={'shown'} config={serviceAndPingAndProductsWithConfigurableScriptAuth} example={`
GET https://example.com/products
`}>
Feel free to experiment with the usual `env=stage`/`env=prod` changes,
(notice that pardon takes a moment to update now.)
</PardonPlayground>

The imported scripts are loaded through the node-module import mechanism
and may import other dependencies (including npm-installed packages).

:::note
The key `pardon:example` is a pardon-relative import.  You can import
external packages too, for instance if you want to customize
your `User-Agent` based on [`os.platform()`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/os.html#osplatform) you could do this

<div class="[&_.copy]:!hidden">
```http title="example/user-agent.mix.https"
import:
  node:os: os
>>>
ANY //
User-Agent: {{= `pardon/1.0 (${os.platform()})` }}
```
</div>

The non-listed import form is equivalent to

<div class="[&_.copy]:!hidden">
```js
import * as os from 'node:os'
```
</div>

## pardon-in-pardon

We've got a new requirement, the business wants our ordering
system to be available to the front-end, and we'll need to do
some validation:

The price of products change frequently, and when a customer
places an order, the price on the screen might not match the price in 
the system: so we need to send the price-on-the-screen and check 
if it's still correct.

That's fair, but also totally annoying for the backend developers
on the order system who have to add more data to every request and 
make sure it's correct.

Well, pardon supports making pardon requests in scripts, and using the
results in expressions.  (We could techincally put this code in an
expression, but it's more readable to put non-trivial code in scripts).

To demonstrate this, first we need to define how to get this data from our
`products/get` endpoint:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="extract product data" icon="">
```http title="example/products/get.https"
>>>
GET https://example.com/products/{{product}}

<<<
200 OK

{
  "name": "{{?name}}",
  "price": "{{?price}}"
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="use output in a script">

Then we can make a helper function that could extract the name
and price from the product respones.

For the following exercise, we'll be using the following script:

```ts title="example/products/products-helper.ts"
import { pardon } from 'pardon';

export async function price({ product, env }: { product: string, env: string }) {
  const {
    inbound: {
      values: { price }
    }
  } = await pardon({ product, env })`https://example.com/products/{{product}}`();

  return price;
}
```

:::note
This price script isn't editable here (it's hacked into the demo system).
:::
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<PardonPlayground response data values='product=P1001' secrets='shown' editor='example/products/get.https' example={`
GET https://example.com/products/{{product}}
`} config={{ ...serviceWithOrderingAndGetMatching, 'example/products/config.yaml': '' }}>
<Exercises>
  <ExerciseItem label='Dynamic data'
    prompt="See what is returned in values.">
  
  Confirm the data extracted for products `P1001`, `P1002`, etc...

  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label='Script integration'
    prompt="Integrate a script.">

This is a multi-step process, first we can define the script as the export
of `pardon:example/products`, to do this, we'll make a few changes:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="1. Setup export">
First we add a `config.yaml` in products
to define its export.
<IconicCode name="editor" titled>
```yaml title="example/products/config.yaml" ins={1}
export: ./products-helper.ts
```
:::note
Be sure to edit the `example/products/config.https` file here.
:::
</IconicCode>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="2. Use in expression">

Next we import the `info` method inside the endpoint we'd like to
use it from and add.

<IconicCode name="editor" titled>
```http title="example/orders/create.https" ins={1-3} ins=" = price({ product, env })"
import:
  pardon:example/products:
    - price
>>>
POST https://example.com/orders

{
  "cart": [{
    "product": "{{items.product}}",
    "quantity": number("{{items.quantity=1}}"),
    "cost": "{{items.cost = price({ product, env })}}"
  }]
}
```
:::note
Be sure to edit the `example/orders/create.https` file here.
:::
</IconicCode>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="3. Make the Call">

Set the input data.
<IconicCode name="setting">
```
items=[{ product: P1001 }, { product: P1002 }]
```
</IconicCode>

And select the correct endpoint:
<IconicCode name="pencil">
```
POST https://example.com/orders
```
</IconicCode>

And now we automatically pass the `price` as `cost`
in the requests.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
  </ExerciseItem>
</Exercises>
</PardonPlayground>

:::tip
We have to be careful with having different
names for our functions since the `items.cost` value
and our `price` function share a namespace (`cost` and `price`).

As in javascript module imports can use `as` to rename imports in
pardon as well.
<div class="[&_.copy]:!hidden">
```yaml ins=/ as.*/
import:
  pardon:example/products:
    - price as productPrice
```
</div>
:::

We have one more thing to fix, though.  The `price` is per-unit
but the `cost` needs to be the `price` multiplied by the `quantity` for each item.

<PardonPlayground response data values='items=[{ product: P1001 }, { product: P1003 }]'
  secrets='shown' editor='example/orders/create.https' example={`
POST https://example.com/orders
`} config={serviceWithAutoCost}>
<Exercises>
  <ExerciseItem label="setup quantities"
    prompt="Assign quantities to order items">
First let's set some quantity on these products:
<IconicCode name="setting">
```text ins=/, quantity: \d+/
items=[
  { product: P1001, quantity: 15 },
  { product: P1003, quantity: 15 }
]
```
Notice the costs are not updated yet.
</IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="multiply"
    prompt="multiply the price by quantity to get the cost">

Here we need to `await` the result since it's an asynchronous request,
and then multiply by the `quantity`. (otherwise Javascript attempts to multiply
a `Promise` by a `number` and that simply doesn't work.)

<IconicCode name="editor" titled>
```http title="example/orders/create.https" ins=".await * quantity"
import:
  ../products/products-helper.ts:
    - price
>>>
POST https://example.com/orders

{
  "cart": [{
    "product": "{{items.product}}",
    "quantity": number("{{items.quantity=1}}"),
    "cost": "{{items.cost = await price({ product, env }) * quantity}}"
  }]
}
```
</IconicCode>

Now the costs are multiplied by the quantities.

:::tip
In pardon JavaScript, we can also write:
```js
price({ product, env }).await * quantity
```

This doesn't help us in this example, but
it's a tiny additonal feature of Pardon-script.
```js 
productInfo({ product, env }).await.price
/* or */
(await productInfo({ product, env })).price
```
:::
  </ExerciseItem>
</Exercises>
</PardonPlayground>

With this kind of scriptable data flow, we can
use pardon to automate the toil of computing some
fields so we focus on the data we care about.

(Remember we can always provide a cost value directly
to skip the script.)

Explain data files, as related to layering?

## Next Steps

We're ready to start descripting testcases and collection layering.
Layering allows a base collection structure to be extended with
team-specific mixins and defaults, allowing the use of an API to
be described differently from the definition.

<CollectionLinkCard href="/intro/layers" />

These next two sections are functionally independent, but
pardon tests leverage collections and layering collections
allows us to share collection layers and operational
needs.
