In Pardon templates, interpolated patterns are substrings beginning with `{{` and ending with `}}`.
Patterns which are entirely one `"{{...}}"` can represent any javascript scalar value:
strings, booleans, numbers, null. (If they're not simple then they can only represent strings, of course).

:::note
Patterns are only recognized in some contexts, for instance,
we don't look for patterns when parsing an http response.
:::

A pattern is composed of the following parts, _and all of them are optional_
(spaces are also allowed around/in many of the syntax elements).

<Tabs class="shadow-md rounded-md">
<TabItem label="param">
<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
<span/>
```text "?" "scope.subscope." ins="param" "=expression" "%/regex/"
{{?scope.subscope.param=expression%/regex/}}
```
<span/>
</FlexyCodeGrid>

The `param` part identifies the value for use in other templates or expressions.

This names the value for use in other expressions, or gives it a name that can be parameterized by
external values (input).
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="hint">
<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
<span/>
```text ins="?" "scope.subscope." "param" "=expression" "%/regex/"
{{?scope.subscope.param=expression%/regex/}}
```
<span/>
</FlexyCodeGrid>

The hint has multiple uses: configuing the regular expression matched by the pattern
and for configuring the rendering / matching engine:

For instance, the inclusion of `?`, `!` and `@` characters:
- `?` marks a pattern optional for rendering.
- `!` marks a pattern required for response matching.
- `@` marks a pattern as redacted in persistence layers and logging.

And `*` changes the default regex from `/.+/` to `/.*/` (but this is context-depdenent).

Currently the hint is defined as zero or more of these characters `.?!@#:~*/+-`.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="expressions">
<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
<span/>
```text "?" "scope.subscope." "param" ins="=expression" "%/regex/"
{{?scope.subscope.param=expression%/regex/}}
```
<span/>
</FlexyCodeGrid>
The expression provides a default value when rendering a pattern.  The expression can reference other
values in the same scope or in parent scopes. (Scopes are discussed more in [schemas](./schemas)).

As it can evaluate to an asynchronous value (a javascript promise), as the result of making another call,
the expression evaluation system was initially designed for automatically handling the generation of auth tokens.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="export scope">
<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
<span/>
```text "?" ins="scope.subscope." "param" "=expression" "%/regex/"
{{?scope.subscope.param=expression%/regex/}}
```
<span/>
</FlexyCodeGrid>
If a pattern is inside a scope (for instance, an array of items), the export scope path provides
a way to name the value in the top level scope. (Scopes are discussed more in <a href="./schemas">schemas</a>).

The input values can also be read through these scope paths.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="regex">
<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
<span/>
```text "?" "scope.subscope." "param" "=expression" ins="%/regex/"
{{?scope.subscope.param=expression%/regex/}}
```
<span/>
</FlexyCodeGrid>
A regex can be specified to override the default regular expression of the pattern.

The default regex for most patterns is `/.+/`, but the `*` hint changes that to `/.*/`.

:::caution
The pattern regex is used only when matching/resolving a schema, in particular,
an evaluated expression is not checked (this includes <span class="text-nowrap">`{{a%/hello/}}`</span> when a is resolved
through <span class="text-nowrap">`{{a = 'world'}}`</span> in another expression).
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="literals">
<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
<span/>
```text /".*"/
{{"{{hello}}"}}
```
<span class="flex-0 place-content-center text-center min-w-5">or</span>
```text  /'.*'/
{{'{{hello}}'}}
```
<span/>
</FlexyCodeGrid>

If you do need a value with `{{` or `}}` in it, you can use double or single-quoted strings to
escape the pattern syntax inside a pattern.

:::note 
Double and single-quoted strings in expressions
are also recognized to not end a pattern.  Javascript back-tick string templates are _not_
since the pattern parsing engine is currently [regex-based](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/1639030)
and string templates can contain string templates!
:::
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


On top of this value-structure we also allow patterns themselves to be transformed by the current
configuration.

## Pattern hints

The hint part annotates the value.  In addition to configuring the rendering and matching engine,
it can be used to configure the regular expression that the pattern expand to.
This can be contextual, for instance, in URLs, `https://example.com/items/{{item}}` would match
`https://example.com/items/abc` but not `https://example.com/items/abc/color`.

If you need to match a path with multiple parts, use the hint `...`:
E.g., `https://example.com/blog/{{...post}}` would match `https://example.com/blog/path/to/my/post`.

:::note
Not currently supported: customized pattern definitions provided by scripts.
