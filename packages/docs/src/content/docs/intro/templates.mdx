Pardon's template/schema engine is the foundation of how Pardon understands and builds
requests.  The engine's main operation is "matching", but the logic includes both
_conflict detection_ and _progressive enhancement_.

The composition of multiple (compatible) templates forms a "schema"
But we'll defer the discussion of exactly what schemas represent and how they are composed for [later](./schemas),
because we can use basic templates without understanding them.

## Templates

Pardon's templates are HTTP-like text, but commonly they represent, in part,
JSON requests.

But to understand how pardon handles the overall request object we need to first
look at how it would operate on a single (string) value in a JSON request.

A "simple" pattern (where the entire string is a single interpolated value)
can match simple values like strings (text), matching these two (in either order)
would be allowed, and additionally resolve `name` to `"some value"`.

<CodeGrid>
```text "{{name}}"
"{{name}}"
```
```text /"some value"/
"some value"
```
</CodeGrid>

Pardon also allows simple templates to match numbers as values,
here we resolve the value `name` to `123` (as a number rather than as a string).
<CodeGrid>
```text "{{name}}"
"{{name}}"
```
```text /123/
123
```
</CodeGrid>

We can also have non-simple templates, a non-simple template can also
break/compose a string (this only makes sense for strings, of course).

<CodeGrid>
```text del="{{greeting}}" ins="{{planetoid}}"
"{{greeting}} {{planetoid}}"
```
```text del="hello" ins="world"
"hello world"
```
</CodeGrid>

If multiple templates for the same value are combined, Pardon will try
to resolve everything.  Here `"hello world"` provides a value for the template,
and so we can resolve both the `"{{value}}"` and the `"{{greeting}} {{planetoid}}"`
template against that.

(This makes sense because `/^(.*) (.*)$/` can only match one way).

<FlexyCodeGrid centered columns={3}>
```text del="{{greeting}}" ins="{{planetoid}}"
"{{greeting}} {{planetoid}}"
```
```text /"{{value}}"/
"{{value}}"
```
```text del="hello" ins="world"
"hello world"
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>
This resolves the three variables as one might expect.
<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
```text del=/greeting = \S*/
greeting = "hello" 
```
```text ins=/planetoid = \S*/
planetoid = "world"
```
```text /value = .*/
value = "hello world"
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>

:::note
The full structure of a `{{...}}` pattern is covered in 
[./patterns](patterns).
:::

Attempting to extend/merge an incompatible template fails: Pardon recognizes these conflicts.

<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
```text del="hello"
"hello"
```
<Icon name="close" />
```text del="world"
"world"
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>

Pardon would also reject this combination, as the template would match the regular expression `/^(.+) (.+)$/`
and `"hello"` is missing a space.

<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
```text del="hello"
"hello"
```
<Icon name="close" />
```text del="world"
"{{greeting}} {{planetoid}}"
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>

:::tip
Pardon is smart enough to reject the combination of `"x-{{abc}}"` and `"y-{{pqr}}"` as long as the _different
part_ is a (not parameterized) incompatible _start_ or _end_ of the pattern.  The patterns `"{{a}}-x-{{b}}"` and `"{{p}}-y-{{q}}"`
could be compatible (e.g., `"w-x-y-z"` with `a = "w"`, `b = "y-z"`, `p = "w-x"`, and `q = "z"`) and Pardon
does not attempt to solve the do-these-regular-expressions-match-anything problem in general.
:::

## Rendering Templates

All by itself, the template `"{{hello}}"` cannot be rendered without
providing some value for `hello`. If this template were matched against the text `"world"`, then
`hello` would be resolved to the value `"world"`.

The value for `hello` could also be provided externally as a value.

We can also provide expressions (javascript!) in templates, which will be evaluated if no value could
be resolved.

<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
```text "hello" "'world'"
"{{hello = 'world'}}"
```
<Icon name="right-arrow" />
```text ins=/".*"/
"world"
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>

But these expression-values match as normal, skipping evaluation.

<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
```text "hello"
"{{hello = 'world'}}"
```
<Icon name="close" />
```text /".*"/
"greetings"
```
<Icon name="right-arrow" />
```text ins=/".*"/
"greetings"
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>

Once a value is resolved (through matching or script evaluation), it can
be referenced in other parts of the same template or as values in scripts.

For example, consider the following template and it's default output
<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
```text
{ a: "{{hello = 'world'}}",
  A: "{{HELLO = hello.toUpperCase()}}" }
```
<Icon name="right-arrow" />
```text ins=/".*"/
{ a: "world",
  A: "WORLD" }
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>

If we merge this schema we can get different results

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="just &quot;a&quot;">
If we specify the value of `a` we resolve `hello="planet"` which becomes
and the expression for `A` uses it instead of the default.
<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
```text /"[a-z]*"/
{ a: "planet" }
```
<Icon name="right-arrow" />
```text /"[a-z]*"/ ins=/"[A-Z]*"/
{ a: "planet", A: "PLANET" }
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="both">
Alternatively, we can resolve both values which skips any expression evaluation here.
<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
```text
{ a: "planet",
A: "jupiter" }
```
<Icon name="right-arrow" />
```text ins=/".*"/
{ a: "planet",
  A: "jupiter" }
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="just &quot;A&quot;">
If we only specify `A`, then `a` retains its default expression and `A` gets
overridden.
<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
```text
{ A: "jupiter" }
```
<Icon name="right-arrow" />
```text ins=/".*"/
{ a: "world",
  A: "jupiter" }
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Pardon can handle any evaluation order that does not result in a cycle
(including asynchronous / promise expressions).

:::caution
If a value has multiple options to be resolved or evaluated: first of all that would be weird,...
but hopefully Pardon is consistent about which option it uses.
:::

## Exploring a template

Moving on to a (slightly more) real example: a REST API that
creates products with a name and a price.

```http
>>>
POST https://example.com/products

{
  "name": "{{name}}",
  "price": "{{price}}"
}
```

This is parsed into a structure and applied to a template defined roughly as the following

<FlexyCodeGrid>
```js
{
  method: "{{method}}",
  url: {
    origin: "{{origin}}",
    pathname: "{{pathname}}"
  },
  headers: [...],
  body: ...
}
```
<Icon name="close" />
```js
{
  method: "POST",
  url: {
    origin: "https://example.com",
    pathname: "/products"
  },
  headers: [],
  body: { "name": "{{name}}",
          "price": "{{price}}" }
}
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>

:::note
The `body`, `headers`, `pathname` patterns all have their own tweaks.  The body is actually
a string template that can handle multiple encodings (determined by the first template that
specifies anything).

For instance, in the pathname `{{x}}` is matched with this regex `/[^/]+/` while `{{...x}}` is matched with `/.*/`,
and `{{/?}}` at the end of a pathname specifies an optional (trailing) slash.
:::

Anyway, let's explore how pardon behaves with this template with these quick exercises.

<p/>
<PardonPlayground example={`
POST https://example.com/products

{
  "name": "sample",
  "price": 9.99
}`} config={productsExample}>

<Exercises>
  <ExerciseItem label="Changing values"
    prompt="Change the values in the body of the request.">

Try updating the name or price values.  Note that since
price is a javascript number value, the rendering of e.g., `"price": 9.00` will
become `"price": 9`.

Conversely, providing arrays or objects for these fields will currently confuse Pardon.
(note: I have not decided if this is a bug or just how things work.)

    <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins="Fez"
POST https://example.com/products

{
  "name": "Fez",
  "price": 9.99
}
```
    </IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="Adding fields"
    prompt="Add another field to the request body.">

Other fields can be added freely into the template.

    <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins=/(?<=9),/ ins=/.*description.*/
POST https://example.com/products

{
  "name": "Fez",
  "price": 9.99,
  "description": "Fezzes are cool"
}
```
    </IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="Adding queries"
    prompt="Add a query param to the request url.">

We can also add query params and pardon can integrate it into the request.
    <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins=/(?<=9),/ ins="?hello=world"
POST https://example.com/products?hello=world

{
  "name": "Fez",
  "price": 9.99
}
```
    </IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="Adding headers"
    prompt="Add a header to the request.">

Headers and query params can also be added, the
base template does not restrict additional data so long
as the additional data can be merged in.

    <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins={2}
POST https://example.com/products
Bowties: also cool

{
  "name": "Fez",
  "price": 9.99,
  "description": "fezzes are cool"
}
```
    </IconicCode>

    <Aside type="caution" title="if you are typing this example out">
    Same as the HTTP wire protocol, a blank line separates the body from the headers.
    </Aside>
  </ExerciseItem>
</Exercises>
</PardonPlayground>

We've covered the basics of how a template supports 
building a request. Feel free to explore negative cases as well: change the URL path or origin,
remove fields from the request, etc... and watch for when pardon can no
longer match the template (<span class="inline-flex relative translate-y-[25%] text-xl"><SolidIcon name="annoyed"/></span>)
or render it (<span class="inline-flex relative translate-y-[25%] text-xl"><SolidIcon name="unhappy"/></span>).

## Scripted values

Expressions can use other values from the template, either resolved through matching
or evaluated in other expressions.

For example, since we have a value for `{{name}}` matched by the template, we
can use the `name` value in an expression for another field.

<PardonPlayground example={`
POST https://example.com/products

{
  "name": "pay-by-the-letter",
  "price": "{{ price = name.length * 10 }}"
}`}
config={productsExample}>

<Exercises>
  <ExerciseItem label="Change value">
    <ExerciseItemPrompt>Change the name to `"pardon‽"`.</ExerciseItemPrompt>

You can see the `price` value change automatically as
you add or remove letters from the name value.

    <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins="pardon‽"
POST https://example.com/products

{
  "name": "pardon‽",
  "price": "{{ price = name.length * 10 }}"
}
```
    </IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="Changing Expressions"
    prompt="Set the price to a quarter per letter.">

Inflation has dropped the demand for luxury letters: we need
to make a drastic price-cut to maintain our order flow rates,
price is now 25 cents a letter.

    <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins="name.length / 4"
POST https://example.com/products

{
  "name": "pardon‽",
  "price": "{{ price = name.length / 4 }}"
}
```
    </IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="Adding Computed Fields"
    prompt="Add another field to the request body.">

That didn't drive orders enough and management is desperate:
we need to highlight our payment plan offering:

<IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins=/(?<=[}]"),/ ins=/.*description.*/ ins=/.*toUpperCase.*/
POST https://example.com/products

{
  "name": "pardon‽",
  "price": "{{ price = name.length*0.25 }}",
  "description":
    "{{= `${name.toUpperCase()} for only 4 easy payments of ${price/4}!`}}"
}
```

(note that parameter expressions don't need a name, we just start with `{{=`...)
</IconicCode>

  </ExerciseItem>
</Exercises>

</PardonPlayground>

{/*
  * Sharp eyes may notice that the `price` is always a string here, rather than a number.
  * This is probably a bug?
  */}
