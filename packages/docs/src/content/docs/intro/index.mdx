## Why you never knew you needed another framework

Most of the existing http frameworks are simply a UI for curl, adding some
parameterization, formatting, and perhaps some support for handling Authorization.

However, the existing frameworks do not attempt to _understand_ the requests being sent,...
and not in some fuzzy semantic level like an AI, but simply
"this is a request to stage, so we need to use stage authorization".

Handling environment switches between stage and production (and local),
the user is faced With the choice to copy, modify, or parameterize requests,
suffering duplicated code (when they copy), request agility (when they modify),
or readability (when they parameterize).

These choices compound when the collections are shared between people or teams, especially
if the copy and modify strategies are chosen.

With a little help, Pardon can understand a request to `https://example.com` is production,
and `https://stage.example.com` is stage, and can then switch or override a request's environment
with a hint as little as `env=stage`.  This means the collection can nominally specify
`https://example.com` (for legibility), but can be used in any environment.

:::note
Efforts like the OpenAPI specification do solve a subset of these issues, like
offering a choice of base URLs. On the other hand, it also abandons the
curl-request-document model, specifying API calls in a special json-schema
format that [looks nothing like](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html#request-body-examples)
the data going over the wire.
:::

## Pardon's approach

Pardon's approach to collection management is different.  Rather than having
collections of requests, Pardon has collections of endpoint templates.

Endpoint template collections are meant to both document and be directly useable by
implementation teams for locally and remotely making requests to their services.

Collection layering (to be described later), allows teams to have collections 
designed for internal use (e.g., adding a local environment) which extend
the shared version.

### Endpoints

Endpoints are written in a format based on HTTP, so it's easier to read and edit
directly in your choice of text editor (or in the Pardon application directly).
Pardon uses endpoint templates to both generate _and_ understand requests, as well
as for parsing and understanding responses.

The user of a collection specifies what request they want, ... more or less.
The specified request needs to contain enough information to uniquely match an endpoint,
and then pardon can take it from there, adding any required headers or authorization,
and can even transforming the call to be made to a different environment (stage, production, and/or
calling the local environment).

:::note
In these tutorials, we will refer to the input request as the "ask",
in contrast to the "request", which is what Pardon would send out to an API.
:::

## Demo time

Let's explore a more concrete example. Consider an `example.com/ping` API

 - is also hosted on `stage.example.com`,
 - requires an explicit `Accept` header,
 - and also needs some kind of `apikey`, ...
   - which is (with no justification besides being useful as an example), different between staging and production.

This `ping.https` endpoint template describes that call.

```http title="example/ping.https"
config:
  origin:
    env:
      prod: https://example.com
      stage: https://stage.example.com
>>>
GET https://example.com/ping
Accept: text/plain
api-key: {{ apikey = (env === "prod" ? "system" : "staging") }}
```

The `config` section informs Pardon about the `env=stage` and `env=prod` environments,
associating the two values of `{{origin}}` (which is the `https://example.com` part of the URL)
with those environments. Pardon can then use that `env` value when evaluating the
expression for `apikey`.

All Pardon needs to use this template is an _ask_ which could be to either `https://example.com/ping`
or `https://stage.example.com/ping`.  Pardon would match either of those to the template, determine
the `env` value from the, and then compute related values like the header from it.

The `pardon` command line utility can, (using only this template), generate (or make)
the full requests directly.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="production">
`pardon` can generate curl-compatible requests.
Using `--curl` tells pardon to render the request rather than send it.
```bash title="https://example.com/ping"
% pardon https://example.com/ping --curl
curl "https://example.com/ping" \
  --header "accept: text/plain" \
  --header "api-key: system"
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="staging">
Pardon produces a different request for the stage origin (not just the URL but also the `api-key` header).
```http frame="terminal" title="https://stage.example.com/ping --curl"
% pardon https://stage.example.com/ping --curl
curl "https://stage.example.com/ping" \
  --header "accept: text/plain" \
  --header "api-key: staging"
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="staging / http">
`pardon` also emits an http format, which is a little easier to read, IMHO.
```http frame="terminal" title="https://stage.example.com/ping --http"
% pardon https://stage.example.com/ping --http
GET https://stage.example.com/ping
accept: text/plain
api-key: staging
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="env=stage">
By adding `env=stage` into the request (anywhere in the command line), we can configure
the request for stage without having to remember the stage origin (perhaps some services
have a `https://stage.example.com` subdomain and others might be hosted on domains
like `https://example-stage.com` etc...).
```http frame="terminal" title="https://example.com/ping --http env=stage"
% pardon https://example.com/ping --http env=stage
GET https://stage.example.com/ping
accept: text/plain
api-key: staging
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let's see how Pardon behaves with this collection.

With the following three exercies, you will see Pardon
expand (render) the _ask_ into the request it would send.

<PardonPlayground example="https://example.com/ping" config={pingExample}>
  <Exercises>
    <ExerciseItem label="ðŸ“–"
      prompt="interactive tutorials">

    </ExerciseItem>
    <ExerciseItem label='â†”'
      prompt="change the request to the stage server">
      Change the host here to to see how pardon
      automatically updates the request. (keep an eye on the `api-key` header)
      <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins="stage."
https://stage.example.com/ping
```
      </IconicCode>
    </ExerciseItem>
    <ExerciseItem label='?'
      prompt='add a query to the input request'>
      Pardon integrates additional query parameters to be included with requests.

      <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins="?hello=world"
https://stage.example.com/ping?hello=world
```
      </IconicCode>
    </ExerciseItem>
    <ExerciseItem label='+'
      prompt='add a header to the input request'>
      Pardon integrates additional headers to be included in requests.

      <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins={2}
https://stage.example.com/ping?hello=world
User-Agent: pardon
```
      </IconicCode>
    </ExerciseItem>
  </Exercises>
</PardonPlayground>

One more point to drive this home: this example should be factored as three separate files,
separating the concerns of service configuration (applying to all requests for the service),
the ping endpoint itself, and the (reusable!) apikey selection mixin:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="service.yaml">
```yaml
config:
  origin:
    env:
      prod: https://example.com
      stage: https://stage.example.com
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="ping.https">
```http
mixin:
  - ./apikey.mix.https
>>>
GET https://example.com/ping
Accept: text/plain
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="apikey.mix.https">
```http
>>>
ANY //
api-key: {{ apikey = (env === "prod" ? "system" : "staging") }}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
