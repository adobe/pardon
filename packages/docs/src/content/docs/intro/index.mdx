## Focused interaction

Pardon works differently that most HTTP frameworks.  With other frameworks,
first the user selects a request or template to build a request.  Pardon
inverts this by selecting a compatible template from the request.

This design focuses the user on the interesting parts of the requests, and the templates
can supply all the nitty-gritty (Content-Type, Authorization, except).

Pardon also can reconfigure requests for different environments.
For instance, Pardon can understand a request to `https://service.example.com` is production,
and `https://service-stage.example.com` is stage, and can switch between them.
Collection can specify the nominal
`https://example.com` (for legibility), but can be used in any environment.

:::note
Efforts like the OpenAPI specification do solve a subset of these issues, like
offering a choice of base URLs.  But the format is very much machine-oriented.
:::

### Focus on HTTP APIs

Requests are written in a format based on HTTP, so they are easier to understand and maintain
in any editor (or source-control) than a json-schema or other proprietary format.

Both requests and request templates share the same HTTP language.

## Demo time

Let's explore a more concrete example. Consider an `example.com/ping` API that

 - also has a stage environnment, `stage.example.com`,
 - requires an explicit `Accept` header,
 - and needs an environment-specific `apikey`.

This `ping.https` endpoint template describes that call.

```http title="example/ping.https"
config:
  origin:
    env:
      prod: https://example.com
      stage: https://stage.example.com
>>>
GET https://example.com/ping
Accept: text/plain
api-key: {{ apikey = (env === "prod" ? "system" : "staging") }}
```

This is a configuration section and then an http request template (after the `>>>`),
the template is interpretted by parsing it and then merging it into the following structure:

<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "origin": "https://example.com",
  "pathname": "/ping",
  "headers": [
    ["accept", "text/plain"],
    ["api-key", "{{ apikey = ... }}"]
  ]
}
```
```js
{
  method: "{{method}}",
  origin: "{{origin}}",
  pathname: "{{pathname}}",
  searchParams: ...,
  headers: ...,
  body: ...
}
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>

Where the template strings `"{{method}}"`and `"{{origin}}"` merge with the
values `"GET"` and `"https://example.com"`, which has the effect of assigning
these values to `method` and `origin`.

The `config` map in the configuration section teaches Pardon about the `env=stage` and `env=prod` environments,
associating the two values of `{{origin}}` to those environments, and vice-versa.
Literal configured values can be overridden or changed in some cases.

Using this template, the input request can be as simple as
"https://example.com/ping" or "https://stage.example.com".
When pardon finds only one template compatible with such a request,
it will use it to fill in all the other details.

For example the `pardon` command line utility can, (using only this template), generate (or make)
the full requests directly.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="production">
Pardon can execute a simple request, like curl, but using templates reduces the noise.
```bash title="https://example.com/ping"
% pardon https://example.com/ping
pong # from prod
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="staging">
Pinging stage is just as easy.
```bash frame="terminal" title="https://stage.example.com/ping"
% pardon https://stage.example.com/ping
pong # from stage
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="staging / http">
`pardon` can emit the http request (without making the call), just add `--http`:
```bash frame="terminal" title="https://stage.example.com/ping --http"
% pardon https://stage.example.com/ping --http
GET https://stage.example.com/ping
accept: text/plain
api-key: staging
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="env=stage">
By adding `env=stage` we can rewrite the request to use stage!

Here we see the output of pardon's "`--curl`" output.
```bash frame="terminal" title="https://example.com/ping --curl env=stage"
% pardon https://example.com/ping env=stage --curl
curl "https://stage.example.com/ping" \
  --header "accept: text/plain" \
  --header "api-key: staging"
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let's explore this further, in a playground environment:

<PardonPlayground example="https://example.com/ping" config={pingExample}>
  <Exercises>
    <ExerciseItem label='â†”'
      prompt="change the request to the stage server">
      Change the host here, watch how pardon updates the request. (keep an eye on the `api-key` header)
```http ins="stage." copy=playground
https://stage.example.com/ping
```
    </ExerciseItem>
    <ExerciseItem label='?'
      prompt='add a query to the input request'>
      Pardon integrates additional query parameters to be included with requests, without
      any changes to the template.
```http ins="?hello=world" copy=playground
https://example.com/ping?hello=world
```
    </ExerciseItem>
    <ExerciseItem label='+'
      prompt='add a header to the input request'>
      Pardon also integrates additional headers to be included in requests, without
      any changes to the templates.
```http ins={2} copy=playground
https://example.com/ping?hello=world
User-Agent: pardon
```
    </ExerciseItem>
    <ExerciseItem label="!"
      prompt='override the request with configuration'>
Any KV (key-value) data can go above the HTTP request to configure it.
```http ins="env=stage" copy=playground
env=stage
https://example.com/ping
```
Notice how this changes the request.
