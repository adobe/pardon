This tutorial builds on the concepts explained in Pardon Templates,

<CollectionLinkCard href="/intro/templates" />

## Services and Endpoints

A Pardon collection is generally one or more services
anchored by a `service.yaml` file and with each endpoint
represented by an `https` (HTTP Schema) file.

Schema files are a sequence of http request and response templates,
and optionally some additional inline configuration.

A basic collection defining a service and the actions for a products REST API might look like this.

<FileTree>
- collection
  - example _the example service_<br/>service="example"
    - service.yaml _common configuration for all the endpoints_
    - ping.https _a basic endpoint_<br/>endpoint=example/ping<br/>action=ping
    - products _we can group related endpoints_
      - create.https _create a product_<br/>action="create"<br/>endpoint="example/products/create"
      - get.https _get a product_<br/>action="get"<br/>endpoint="example/products/get"
      - update.https _update a product_
      - delete.https _delete a product_
      - list.https _list products_
</FileTree>

:::note
The `service`, `action` and `endpoint` values here can be specified
to help pardon resolve an ambiguous request, or make a request entirely by key-values
and templating without any HTTP _ask_ at all.
:::

When developing a collection, one might start with a `service.yaml` and
confirm the setup with something like a `ping.https` endpoint.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label='service.yaml'>
The `service.yaml` file contains common specifications like
`config`, `defaults`, and `mixin`s (which we'll get to later in this tutorial).
```yaml
config:
  origin:
    env:
      prod: https://example.com
      stage: https://stage.example.com
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='ping.https'>
And our `ping.https` file specifies how to make the ping call to the service.

```http
>>>
GET https://example.com/ping
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

So far, so good: we should be able to build requests for both stage and production origins.

## Input values

The input request is the "most direct" mechanism for getting data into Pardon, but not
everything can be solved without another layer of indirection! <span class="inline-block translate-y-[10%] text-lg"><SolidIcon name="wink"/></span>

Values can supply data to templates, and can even be used to rewrite
templates where `config` alternatives are involved.

In these exercises a new input field for values is available to
explore this mechanism (the <span class='inline-icon'><Icon name="setting" /></span> input). 

<PardonPlayground
  values
  example={`GET https://example.com/ping`}
  config={serviceAndPing}>
<Exercises>
  <ExerciseItem label="Values input"
    prompt="Try setting a value in the values input.">

    `config` choices can be overridden with values.  This allows
    any request to be easily repurposed to a different environment
    (in particular, replaying tests).
    <IconicCode name="setting">
```properties ins="env=stage"
env=stage
```
    </IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="Values override"
    prompt="Override the the request input">
    Set `env=prod` to override `https://stage.example.com`.

    (try the other way as well).
    <IconicCode name="setting">
```properties ins="prod"
env=prod
```
    </IconicCode>
    <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http
GET https://stage.example.com/ping
```
    </IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
</Exercises>
</PardonPlayground>

<div class="pt-5"/>
:::tip
When using the `pardon` commandline utility, values can be
specified with `key=value` syntax anywhere in the arguments.

```bash "env=stage"
% pardon https://example.com/ping env=stage --http
curl "https://stage.example.com/ping"
```

We can also omit any http or URL data and select an endpoint directly

```bash "endpoint=example/ping" 
% pardon endpoint=example/ping env=stage --http
GET https://stage.example.com/ping
```
:::

### A RESTful resource

The products lifecycle would also defined with https files:

For product creation, this template only defines the `name` field (which makes it mandatory),

```http title="create.https"
>>>
POST https://example.com/products
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "{{name}}"
}
```

Defining the response template instructs pardon to extract the `product` value
from the response, assuming it matches.
Equally importantly, it provides a little documentation about the
shape of the response for humans. We will cover dataflow in a
later section, as it's more of an advanced topic for scripting.

The REST of the product resources endpoints are specified minimally here, just enough
to distinguish them from each other.

<Tabs>{/* note: https://github.com/expressive-code/expressive-code/issues/22 would be nice here */}
  <TabItem label='get.https'>
Requests info for a single product.

```http title="example/products/get.https"
>>>
GET https://example.com/products/{{product}}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='update.https'>
Updates info for a single product.

```http title="example/products/update.https"
>>>
PUT https://example.com/products/{{product}}
Content-Type: application/json

{}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='delete.https'>
Deletes a single product.

```http title="example/products/delete.https"
>>>
DELETE https://example.com/products/{{product}}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='list.https'>
Lists products.

```http title="example/products/list.https"
>>>
GET https://example.com/products
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

With all this set up we can finally explore how pardon works with a collection of requests.

<PardonPlayground
  values="env=stage"
  example={`POST https://example.com/products`}
  config={serviceAndPingAndProducts}>

<Exercises>
  <ExerciseItem label="Values input"
    prompt="Set a value via values." >

    Notice how we can provide the `{{name}}` value here without having to specify
    a request body at all!

    Many simple requests can be parameterized to take advantage of this abbreviated input mechanism.
    <IconicCode name="setting">
```http ins="name=thneed"
env=stage name=thneed
```
    </IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="Parameterized value"
    prompt="Add a parameterized query param"
    icon="puzzle">

In the spirit of progressive enhancement,
we can add a parameterized value in our input,

    <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins="?type={{type}}"
GET https://stage.example.com/products?type={{type}}
```
    </IconicCode>
    and then define it.
    <IconicCode name="setting">
```http ins="type=pencils"
env=prod type=pencils
```
    </IconicCode>
    <ExerciseItemPrompt>How can we make supplying the `type` optional?</ExerciseItemPrompt>
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="No-HTTP usage"
    prompt="Select the endpoint directly with parameterization.">

    The `service`, `action`, and `endpoint` values can be used
    to select (or at least dramatically narrow down) which endpoint templates Pardon
    even attempts to evaluate.

    First, please delete the entire input. We don't need it!
    <IconicCode name="pencil">
    <div class="[&_code]:!min-h-5 [&_.copy]:!hidden no-copy">
```http del=/.*/
POST https://example.com/products
```
    </div>
    </IconicCode>
    Then select the endpoint directly.
    <IconicCode name="setting">
```http ins="endpoint=example/products/list"
endpoint=example/products/list
```
    </IconicCode>
    you can try different endpoints, and/or `env=stage` if you like,
    for the get/update/delete endpoints, you'll need to specify a
    `product=...` value as well.
    :::note
    This only works for `GET` method endpoints.

    Non-GET endpoints need the `method` specified as well, this
    adds a little friction to prevent accidental `POST` requests.

<IconicCode name="setting">
```
endpoint=example/products/create method=POST name=thneed
```
</IconicCode>

</Exercises>
</PardonPlayground>

## Mixins

Oh no. In our rush to add features, we forgot to include authorization headers to call these endpoints:
the security team took care of this in the gateway on stage, and now all of our endpoints need
to be updated, and tested.

We want to tell Pardon that this _service_ needs authentication, rather than updating every endpoint.
We just need to specify a mixin at the service level.

```yaml title="example/service.yaml" {6-7}
config:
  origin:
    env:
      prod: https://example.com
      stage: https://stage.example.com
mixin:
  - ./auth.mix.https
```

We're putting it next to our service in the file tree.  But any relative path inside the
service directory is fine.

<FileTree>
- collection
  - example
    - service.yaml
    - auth.mix.https
    - ping.https
    - products/
      - create.https
      - ...
</FileTree>

The contents look (kind of) like any other https endpoint.

```http title="example/auth.mix.https"
>>>
ANY //
Authorization: {{ @auth = `${env}-auth-token` }}
```

The special request method `ANY` matches _all_ request methods, and the special value `//` matches _any_ URL.
(A "mixin" is mixed-in _only if_ it is "compatible" with the request.)

This adds an authorization header to all requests.

<Aside type="tip" title="Redacting secret values">

{/* This doesn't really fit here, but I don't know where else to slot it in. */}

HTTP requests unfortunately contain multiple types of information: information
that selects an endpoint, information that we want to send to the endpoint,
and information that we need to send to tell the server who we are.  This last
category of values are often both security sensitve and (relatively) useless
for human comprehension, so we tend to redact them.

Template values decorated with `@` are considered secrets, and Pardon knows to keep them
out of durable locations, and just generally hide them by default.

:::note
Commonly, we would compute the secret using an imported function.

```http
Authorization: {{ @auth = makeAccessToken(env) }}
```

where `makeAccessToken` is an async function exported from a javascript
(or typescript) file, and it could be implemented by calling another
pardon endpoint.
:::
</Aside>

Let's try it out in stage and confirm all our endpoints are working and have authorization
applied... (The `@` in `@auth` marks it a secret. You can see the value using the lock button
in this exercise.).

<PardonPlayground
  secrets
  editor
  example={`GET https://stage.example.com/products`}
  config={serviceAndPingAndProductsWithAuth} />

:::note
In the introduction, we described the collection templates as specifying the "bones" of the API call,
and the input request as the "meat".  Now we're using the template system to add additional information
to the request which is neither part of the determination of which API endpoint to call, nor is it part
of the interesting data being sent.  This type of data is more like "feathers".  We're not going to use
this analogy, I just thought it might be interesting to think about.
:::

### Mixin-Match

> TL;DR: mixins progressively enhance the input request, but only if they match.
> 
> They do not affect whether the endpoint template matches the input request.

Awesome! We've got a security measure applied to our requests.
And we provided confirmation of all our requests working on stage, so ops rolled
these changes out to production.

Unfortunately, now alerts are firing because the (oops, only in production!)
liveness probe hitting `/ping` requires an auth token and is not provisioned to use one.
We missed this case in staging because our updated collection sent auth
tokens to _every_ endpoint.

Well, it's not _actually_ an outage, and the fix isn't even on our end (ops is in control of
removing the Authorization header check from the /ping endpoint),
but we do want to adjust our collection to align with the deployment.

:::caution
One option is removing the mixin from service.yaml and including it selectively from every authenticated endpoint.

<Tabs>{/* note: https://github.com/expressive-code/expressive-code/issues/22 would be nice here */}
  <TabItem label='service'>
```yaml title="example/service.yaml" del={6-7}
config:
  origin:
    env:
      prod: https://example.com
      stage: https://stage.example.com
mixin:
  - ./auth.mix.https
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='create'>
```http title="example/products/create.https" ins={1,2}
mixin:
  - ../auth.mix.https
>>>
POST https://example.com/products
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='get'>
```http title="example/products/get.https" ins={1,2}
mixin:
  - ../auth.mix.https
>>>
GET https://example.com/products/{{product}}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='update'>
```http title="example/products/update.https" ins={1,2}
mixin:
  - ../auth.mix.https
>>>
PUT https://example.com/products/{{product}}
Content-Type: application/json

{}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='delete'>
```http title="example/products/delete.https" ins={1,2}
mixin:
  - ../auth.mix.https
>>>
DELETE https://example.com/products/{{product}}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='list'>
```http title="example/products/list.https" ins={1,2}
mixin:
  - ../auth.mix.https
>>>
GET https://example.com/products
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

but that touches many files.
As the collection grows, this kind of maintenance would grow as well.
:::

It is cleaner (in this case, at least) to specify an opt-out for the few
exceptional endpoints that don't need auth, rather than opting-in.
To have the mixin supply an opt-out behavior, we can add a `config` section.

```http title="example/auth.mix.https" ins={1-2}
config:
  authorization: token
>>>
ANY //
Authorization: {{ @auth = `${env}-auth-token` }}
```

Just like `origin` in the main request, this `authorization` value needs to match
(or be not specified) in the input for this mixin to be applicable.

We can then default `authorization` as `none` in our ping endpoint
(choosing any value _other_ than `token`), which disables the mixin selectively.

```http title="example/ping.https" ins={1-2}
defaults:
  authorization: none
>>>
GET https://example.com/ping
```
This implements the same change in behavior with _two changes_ instead of N+1,
and provides some additional controls we explore here:

<PardonPlayground
  secrets
  values
  example={`GET https://example.com/products`}
  config={serviceAndPingAndProductsWithConfigurableAuth} >

<Exercises>
  <ExerciseItem label="ping"
    prompt="Set the endpoint to ping.">
    Notice the authorization header disappears as expected.
    <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins="ping"
GET https://example.com/ping
```
    </IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="pong"
    prompt="Send authorization to ping anyway?">
    Override the default `authorization` to force an authenticated ping request!
    <IconicCode name="setting">
```properties ins="authorization=token"
authorization=token
```
    </IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="disable auth"
    prompt="Send an unauthenticated request to products.">
    Override the default `authorization` to force an unauthenticated products request.
    Why would we do this?  I don't know, maybe for testing?  To assert dominance over our framework?
    <IconicCode name="setting">
```properties ins="authorization=token"
authorization=none
```
    </IconicCode>
    <IconicCode name="pencil">
```http ins="products"
GET https://example.com/products
```
    </IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
</Exercises>

## Collection Layering

To match team structures, collections are defined in layers:

A base layer might define the endpoints, but credentials
can be defined in another.  Different teams have different
access to credentials to the same services, so Pardon supports
separation of concerns and access requirements by allowing
layers of functionality to be applied.

A root pardon config defines the layers of collections
to use. We'll need to revisit this in the section on scripting.

## Next Steps

Next we will cover more dataflow mechanisms.

<CollectionLinkCard href="/intro/dataflow"/>

Afterwards we will revisit layering a bit in scripting.
