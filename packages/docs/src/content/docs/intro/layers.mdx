## Stacking layers

In pardon, we have collections which are organized by services, 
and the endpoints are organized within these directories.
The design invites version controlled and broad sharing,
but that, in turn, limits what kind of specifics can go into the
collection.

For instance, where to source credentials for the same services differs
across teams, and also perhaps some other defaults and patterns of use.

To support easy inter-team, intra-team, and personal (or other) patterns
of use, a Pardon application context references one or more collection
layers and composes them.

For example, let's add a layer to the base `service.yaml` of our example service.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="base">
  The base configuration defines production and staging endpoints,
  which is fine for sharing, but what about the developers of the service
  testing locally on their machines?
```http title=".../common/collection/example/service.yaml" {3-5}
config:
  origin:
    env:
      prod: https://example.com
      stage: https://stage.example.com
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="dev-team">
  We can extend the configuration with another option.
  Because the config structure is based on maps, there's really only one
  way for this to be interpreted. <span class="inline-icon"><SolidIcon name="wink" class="text-lg"/></span>
  
  With this Now `env=local` will configure any call
  to go to `http://localhost:8080`.
```http title=".../dev/collection/example/service.yaml" ins={3-4}
config:
  origin:
    env:
      local: http://localhost:8080
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

With targetted overrides, we can define additional configurations,
update defaults, and add or customize mixins.

<PardonPlayground
  editor="/extension/example/service.yaml"
  values
  data
  example="https://example.com/ping"
  layers={simpleLayers.layers}
  config={{
    ...simpleLayers.config,
    '/extension/example/service.yaml': `
`.trim() }}>
<Exercises>
  <ExerciseItem label="env=local"
    prompt="extend the configuration with a local env">

    Let's try this out! First, we extend the our
    service configuration with a local environment:
    <IconicCode titled name="editor">
```http title="/extension/example/service.yaml" ins={1-4}
config:
  origin:
    env:
      stage: ...
      prod: ...
      local: http://localhost:8080
```
    </IconicCode>
    We want to retain the `stage` and `prod` configs here but
    by specifying `...` we don't need to repeat their definitions.

    Then we can configure the request for local
    <IconicCode name="setting">
```
env=local
```
    </IconicCode>
    You can also try setting the URL to `http://localhost:8080/ping`
    instead, as always, feel free to experiment.
  </ExerciseItem>
  <ExerciseItem label="flexible port"
    prompt="allow flexibility with the port">
    We don't need to choose `:8080` as our port here.
    It's nice that `env=local` works by itself, but maybe we're running
    a service on 8080 and we'd like to use `port=8081` one
    time.

    As you might expect, we can do this with a default port number variable.
    <IconicCode titled name="editor">
```http title="/extension/example/service.yaml" ins=/[{][{].*}}/
config:
  origin:
    env:
      local: http://localhost:{{port=8080}}
```
    </IconicCode>

    Then we can configure the request for local
    <IconicCode name="setting">
```
env=local port=8081
```
    </IconicCode>
  </ExerciseItem>
</Exercises>
</PardonPlayground>

### Disambiguating requests

The above `http://localhost:8080/ping` request is unambiguous
in the context of a single example service, a developer will
likely be running more than one from time to time, and
perhaps the rules (headers) for calling these services
differs a little bit.

Pardon will happily call `env=local` + `https://example.com/ping` 
but will be confused by `http://localhost:8080/ping` without additional context.

The following exercises should help clarify this situation.
Here we've defined another `sample` service that also
takes the `x-sample: true` header for its ping endpoint.

<PardonPlayground
  values
  example="GET https://example.com/ping"
  layers={simpleLayers.layers}
  config={{
    ...simpleLayers.config,
    ...Object.entries(simpleLayers.config)
      .reduce((map, [key, value]) => Object.assign(map, {
        [key.replace('example', 'sample')]: value.replace(/example/g, 'sample')
      }), {}),
    '/collection/sample/ping.https': `
>>>
GET https://sample.com/ping
x-sample: true
    `.trim()
  }}>
<Exercises>
  <ExerciseItem label="service=..."
    prompt="Disambiguate an ambiguous request.">
    Try changing the request to a localhost ping, observe
    that pardon doesn't quite know how to handle it.
    <IconicCode name="pencil">
```
http://localhost:1337/ping
```
    </IconicCode>
    To help pardon out, specify a `service` value (<span class="inline-icon"><SolidIcon name="setting"/></span>)
<FlexyCodeGrid centered>
```text "service" ins="example"
service=example
```
```text "service" ins="sample"
service=sample
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>
    Doing this gives pardon the missing context it needs.
    (`endpoint=example/ping` also works, `action=ping` does not help here).

{/* TODO
Examples demonstrating how endpoints and mixins stack:
- How templates compose and any one can reject the mixin or endpoint.
- How configurations are pre-composed for the context of each of
the templates (are there cases where that matters?).
- Script import stacking (not implemented in code yet either).
- Data import stacking!
- Pardon context (`.pardonrc.yaml`) definitions and ...
