Previously we covered Pardon's templates, and that they are composed into schemas.

<CollectionLinkCard href="/intro/templates" />

Here discuss the process of generating and/or applying a schema to a template 
and how that resolves to a new schema.

## Schemas

In Pardon, the templates are _not_ "text documents with templating" which are rendered independently
of their context and parsed after-the-fact. (As a hall-of-shame example of this, consider 
the fragility of the helm chart `{{- toYaml .Values.doc | indent 10}}` syntax.)

Templates are treated as _values_ with implict and contextual rules.

Pardon's http/https template files
 - are parsed to an HTTP object, and
 - that template is then used to extend a base schema.

### Schema Operations

A schema supports the following major operations:

 - **match** - merges the current schema with a template.
   The match operation has three submodes, configuring how arrays and patterns are handled.

   - **mix** - treats the template as an abstract schema, patterns are recognized and single element arrays are treated as schemas for the elements of the array (non-1-element arrays are treated as tuples)
   - **mux** - treats the template as a concrete schema, patterns are still recognized.
   - **match** - treats the template as a literal, patterns are not recognized.

   Matching can _resolve_ values: when a value overlaps a pattern, the variables in the pattern can be resolved.
   Some values are not resolved at match time because they're provided by executing (possibly asynchronous) scripts,
   these values would be evaluated when the schmea is _rendered_.

 - **render** - renders the schema into a resulting value, this is the first time pardon ever considers _evaluating_ any script expressions in templated values.
   (there are multiple subtypes of render as well, like **preview** that avoids running scripts, but these
   don't affect how the schema was constructed from templates, so they're not important to cover here).

So, in essence, a schema is produced by **match**ing templates and the "ask"ed request, and it can be
**render**ed into a request object synthesized from all those resolved inputs and any evaluated scripts.

{/* TODO: explain and emphasize the match=resolve / render=evaluate phases and distinction further */}

## Scopes

### Export Scope Paths

{/* yoinked from templates.mdx, need to reintroduce export scope paths here */}

The following schema and match combination would produce no exported values since `"a"` is 
scoped to each element of the list.
<FlexyCodeGrid>
```js
{ list: [{
  a: "{{a}}",
  b: "{{b=a+1}}"
}] }
```
<Icon name="close"/>
```js
{ list: [{
  a: 10
}, {
  a: 20
}] }
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>

In contrast the following schema would be able to export an
`items` array from the top-level scope.
<FlexyCodeGrid>
```js
{ list: [{
  a: "{{items.a}}",
  b: "{{items.b=a+1}}"
}] }
```
<Icon name="close"/>
```js
{ list: [{
  a: 10
}, {
  a: 20
}] }
```
<Icon name="right-arrow"/>
```
items=[
  { a=10, b=15 },
  { a=20, b=25 }
]
```
</FlexyCodeGrid>

:::caution
The export scope values are (currently) `resolve`-only... they are not available
in expressions.
