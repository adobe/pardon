:::tip
These docs assume a NodeJS installation and basic experience with 
`git`, `node`, and `npm`, and `README.md` files.

The quickstart here is intended to quickly showcase Pardon's features
without going into the details of how it works.  The other tutorials
are intended to explain more.
:::

The `example/todo` repo contains a sample server and Pardon collection.
You can use this to demo some workflows.

## Installation and Building

To get started with Pardon, first build the Pardon application.
```bash title="building pardon"
$ git clone https://github.com/adobe/pardon.git
$ cd pardon
$ npm install
$ npm install --prefix=packages/core
$ npm install --prefix=packages/favor
$ npm run package --prefix=packages/favor # this also rebuilds pardon's core
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Building on Windows">
<details>
<summary>When building on windows, instead of using `--prefix`, please `cd` to the various subdirectories.</summary>
```bash title="powershell or cmd"
$ git clone https://github.com/adobe/pardon.git
$ cd pardon
$ npm install
$ cd packages/core
$ npm install
$ cd ../favor
$ npm install
$ npm run package
```
</details>
</Aside>

The Pardon application is built into `./packages/favor/out/...`
(path depends on your plaform, osx and windows should both work,
have not tested any linux flavors yet.)

Optionally, you can link the built application as a command-line tool as well.
```bash title="optional"
$ cd packages/core
$ npm link .
# undo this with npm uninstall -g pardon
```

## Setup the example-todo service

In another folder clone the `example/todo` branch.

```bash
$ git clone  https://github.com/adobe/pardon.git -b example/todo example-todo
$ cd example-todo
$ npm start # runs a local server
```

This runs a simple in-memory-store "TODO list" application as a local service.
This will give the ability to make basic CRUD operations via pardon
and view the current list of tasks (in a browser)

The repository contains a simple server:
<FileTree>
- package.json     support for `npm start` to run the server
- server/
  - mini-server.js  minimal server framework
  - index.js        basic TODO app frontend/backend logic
</FileTree>

... and a Pardon project / collection for interacting with that server:
<FileTree>
- package.json      includes `"pardon": {}` configuration
- collection/todo/
  - service.yaml    configuration for our todo environments
  - ping.https      ping the service
  - list.https      list the todos
  - update.https    update a todo entry
  - get.https       get a todo entry
  - create.https    create a new todo entry
  - delete.https    delete a todo entry
  - todo-helper.ts  functions for working with the service
  - toggle.mix.https a mixin for making update "toggle"
- pardon.test.ts    testcases for this service
</FileTree>

After running `npm start`, please open a browser to [`http://localhost:3000`] to view the TODO list.

## Open the example workspace

It's time to run the pardon application (find it in `./packages/favor/out/...`) and
set the context to the `example-todo` directory (setting the context is in the file menu).

If everything went well, you should have

```
env=local
```
in the globals, and
```http
GET https://todo.example.com/ping
```
in the main input.  This request should be shown as `GET http://localhost:3000/ping`
and there should be a button to actually make the request.

If the server is running, you can run this and get `pong` back.

You should also see the list of endpoints, (with ping highlighted because it matches
the current request).
<FileTree>{/* not the best component for this*/}
- todo
  - create
  - delete
  - get
  - list
  - **ping**
  - update
</FileTree>

The other endpoint we can run trivially is `list`,
select that and the request editor will change to

```http
GET https://todo.example.com/todos
```

and when we run this we should get back something like this

```http
200 OK
connection: close
content-length: 65
content-type: application/json
date: --- now ---

[
  {
    "task": "get setup with pardon",
    "completed": false,
    "id": "T1001"
  }
]
```

From this we see a pre-populated task with pardon has an id of `T1001`.

To change this, we can use the update endpoint

```text ins="todo=T1001" ins="completed=true"
todo=T1001
completed=true

PUT https://todo.example.com/todos/{{todo}}
```

alternatively, we can specify this entirely with values given an `endpoint` and other data.

```text ins="todo=T1001" ins="completed=true"
method=PUT
endpoint=todo/update
todo=T1001
completed=true
```

:::note
for sanity, pardon defaults `method` to `GET` if not specified, which is done for various reasons
but most importantly it is intended to prevent accidents.
:::

Remember to keep the <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:3000</a>
page open while you run this to see the todo list update from the API calls.

Try again, but with `completed=false` to mark the todo action as pending again.

```text ins="false"
todo=T1001
completed=false

PUT https://todo.example.com/todos/{{todo}}
```

## Automation

Manually changing `completed` every time we want to toggle something is great,
but what if we could automatically compute the `completed` for each request?

For this next experiment, instead of setting the `completed` value, try `do=toggle`
(use the "samples" directory to even-more-easily configure the request.)

```text ins="do=toggle"
todo=T1001
do=toggle

PUT http://todo.example.com/todos/{{todo}}
```

this will automatically produce the opposite value of completed each time this request
is rendered.

The details are covered in later tutorials, but what we have here is pardon requests
making pardon requests... executing the following script:

```ts title="todo-helper.ts"
import { pardon } from "pardon";

type TodoOptions = { origin: string; todo: string; };

export async function getCompleted({ origin, todo }: TodoOptions) {
  const { inbound } = await pardon({
    origin,
    todo,
  })`GET https://todo.example.com/todos/{{todo}}`();

  return inbound.values.completed;
}
```

The operative files here are the `get.https` endpoint, where `completed` is parsed
from the response, and `toggle.mix.https` for how `getCompleted` is used in a template.

Making successive calls using this configuration can now toggle the todo's `completed` value.

You can see in the application via the history, that the call made was dependent on the `GET` call
first. (Pardon tracks which promises are `await`ed to build this graph!).

## Next Steps

Now that we've seen the behavior of `pardon`, we can explore its inner workings,
starting with the template/schema engine.
