<summary>Why the name Pardon?</summary>

**"Pardon‽"** was my initial reaction to another HTTP framework's decision
to delete the collections I had been using locally for years in a bid to
force me to create an account.

<summary>What's with the icon?</summary>

<Image src={PardonIcon} width={50} alt="Pardon Icon" />

The icon is an interrobang, Merriam-Webster [defines](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interrobang)
the interrobang as

> a punctuation mark ‽ designed for use especially at the end of an exclamatory rhetorical question.

for Pardon, there are two more reasons it was chosen:

 - as an interrobang, it represents the two basic kinds of HTTP requests, e.g., GET (?) and POST (!).
 - as an image, it looks a "P" for Pardon, LOL.

The design itself is based off of Dav AT's [submission
to the noun project](https://thenounproject.com/icon/interrobang-6298923/)
and was reworked into an application icon using Adobe® Illustrator.

<summary>What's the future of this project?</summary>

I don't know.  There's so much more to be done, and yet, it's largely solving
the problems it set out to solve.

If nothing else, Pardon demonstrates an integration of some templating concepts, a
concurrency data model (computation dependency tracking used to implement pseudo-global values
without race conditions), and a language for structured list generation (maybe good for fuzzers?).

It would be great if these concepts will find new usages in other places, but if nothing
else, this project is solving my needs for a http api-client reqeust framework and I
sincerely hope it grows to solve yours as well.
