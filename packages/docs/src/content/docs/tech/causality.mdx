Node's async_hooks API has been "experimental" since it was introducted 
in Node 8:

<div class="p-2 border-2 border-solid dark:border-neutral-600 border-neutral-300 rounded-sm">
{/* directly adapted from https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/async_hooks.html (v22.3.0) */}
<div class="bg-orange-600 dark:bg-orange-700 rounded-sm px-3 py-2 text-white [&_code]:!bg-transparent [&_.href]:underline">
<span class='href'>Stability: 1</span> - Experimental. Please migrate away from this API, if you can.
We do not recommend using the <span class='href'><code>createHook</code></span>, <span class='href'><code>AsyncHook</code></span>, and
<span class='href'><code>executionAsyncResource</code></span> APIs as they have usability issues, safety risks,
and performance implications. Async context tracking use cases are better
served by the stable <span class='href'><code>AsyncLocalStorage</code></span> API. If you have a use case for
<code>createHook</code>, <code>AsyncHook</code>, or <code>executionAsyncResource</code> beyond the context
tracking need solved by <span class='href'><code>AsyncLocalStorage</code></span> or diagnostics data currently
provided by <span class='href'>Diagnostics Channel</span>, please open an issue at
<span class='href'>{'https'}://github.com/nodejs/node/issues</span> describing your use case so we can
create a more purpose-focused API.

We're using it anyway! <span class='inline-icon'><SolidIcon size={20} name="wink" /></span>

## Concurrent Serial Tests

Other http frameworks provide a single thread of execution, and a global
environment object which is used to configure each request and response in turn.

With Pardon, we offer the same ergonomics of a "global object" (`environment`), but the values assigned
to this object are independent of the execution order: only _awaited_ updates are visible in
the "global" object.

Underlying this is a tracking system that understands
_what happened_ to reach a certain point by way of a series of tracked values.
(One might think of these as magic breadcrumbs).

With single-threaded (non-concurrent) usage, `track(value)` looks like it pushes a value
onto a list and `awaited()` returns that list:

```js
const {
  track,
  awaited
} = tracker();

track('a');
awaited(); // ['a']

track('b');
track('c');
awaited(); // ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

However in an async context, a tracked value
won't become visible until the execution that tracked it is awaited.

```js
const { track, awaited } = tracker();

async function f() { await randomDelay(); track('f'); };
async function g() { await randomDelay(); track('g'); };

const pf = f();
const pg = g();

... // we could await a delay here and it wouldn't change the next value of awaited

awaited() // []

await pf;

awaited(); // ['f']

await pg;

awaited(); // ['f', 'g']

// further awaits of pf/pg here will not change the result.
```

Notice that `awaited()` above will always return the tracked values in `awaited` order,
despite the fact that the tracking might have been in the reverse order due to the `randomDelay()s`.

This might feel a bit weird at first, but it is _stable_, as the composition/order of the `awaited()`
values will be based only on the (stable) "lexical shape" of the code, rather than the
unstable order of execution.

In tests, we use this to track assignments to a global environment value.
We also track dependent requests that might be executed via script helpers to
surface dependent requests in `favor`.

:::caution
Some async constructs are inherently inconsistent, such as `Promise.race`.

You can still use these if you like but the guarantees get weaker.
:::

## How this tracks

The tracked values are stored in nodes of an execution graph maintained
with the `async_hooks` API NodeJS discourages using.

The nodes of the execution graph essentially have two links:
- the `init` link is for the context in which the promise is created, and
- the `trigger` link is to the promise that preceeds the execution.

The creation of an execution node looks something like this, with `init` being the node where a promise
is created and `trigger` is the promise that must complete to start the execution.

```ts ins="promise" del=/trigger(?=[.])/
function init(trigger: Promise<unknown>) {
  return promise = trigger.then(() => { ... });
}
```

Calling `awaited()` effectively collects tracked values by searching this graph,
with priority given to values tracked in the init execution before the trigger execution.

The implementation has diverged from a graph search, for both efficiency and to
facilitate garbage collection of the tracked values as the promise objects become unreachable.

:::caution
One gotcha is `async function`s are
not run entirely async.

In the following case:
```js
async function hello() { 
  track('world');
  ...
}

hello(); // not awaited, but track('world') is executed synchronously so...
awaited(); // [..., 'world'] will be present here.
```

## Garbage Collection

Like all non-trivial abstractions, this one leaks: in particular it leaks memory.

The awaited values _are_ garbage-collected along with promises as much as possible,
but sometimes we need to control this behavior.

 - `shared(() => { ... })` executes without any initial tracked values.
 - `disconnected(() => { ... })` does not expose any values tracked in its execution.

Both of these methods asynchronosuly start executing their function and
return a promise for its result.  (These mechanisms are currently global
across all track/awaited pairs.)

### Shared Execution

`shared()` is used for executing asynchronous operations where the promise may be cached/reused.
It prevents the tracked values from the initial execution being part of the result, and 
Awaiting a shared promise still integrates any values that were tracked during its execution.

Consider the following,...
```js
function getAuthToken() { 
  return authTokenPromise ??= fetchAuthToken();
}
```
in this case the `authTokenPromise` will inherit the tracked values
leading to the first call of `fetchAuthToken()` only.  This introduces
a race condition as the tracked results of `getAuthToken()` would
depend on who called it first.  Additionally the `fetchAuthToken()` function
would have access to the `awaited()` values of its first caller.

To fix this, we use `shared` to disconnect the execution graph leading into the call.

```js
function getAuthToken() { 
  return authTokenPromise ??= shared(() => fetchAuthToken());
}
```

Inside `fetchAuthToken()` the `awaited()` list will be clear.
Any values tracked inside `fetchAuthToken()` can still be awaited from the `authTokenPromise`.

### Disconnected Execution

`disconnected()` is used to drop tracked values.  Awaiting a disconnected result does not add
any more tracked values to the next `awaited()` call.

We use this to reduce the maximum impact of running a large number of test cases, for instance.
