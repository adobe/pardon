Node's the async_hooks API has been "experimental" since it was introducted 
in Node 8.

<div class="p-2 border-2 border-solid dark:border-neutral-600 border-neutral-300 rounded-sm">

<span class='href'>Stability: 1</span> - Experimental. Please migrate away from this API, if you can.
We do not recommend using the <span class='href'><code>createHook</code></span>, <span class='href'><code>AsyncHook</code></span>, and
<span class='href'><code>executionAsyncResource</code></span> APIs as they have usability issues, safety risks,
and performance implications. Async context tracking use cases are better
served by the stable <span class='href'><code>AsyncLocalStorage</code></span> API. If you have a use case for

create a more purpose-focused API.

## Ordering Causality

Other http frameworks provide a single thread of execution, and a global
environment object which is used to configure each request and response in turn.

With Pardon, we offer the same ergonomics of a "global object", but the behavior
is independent of the execution order: since only _awaited_ assignments to the
global object count.

The base of this is a tracking system that understands
_what happened_ to reach a certain point, by way of a series of tracked values.

In a single threaded usage, `track(value)` looks like it pushes a value
onto a list and `awaited()` returns that list.

```js
const {
  track,
  awaited
} = tracker();

track('a');
awaited(); // ['a']

track('b');
track('c');
awaited(); // ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

However if we have some asynchronous processes that track values,
we won't see them get tracked until we we `await` those promises.

```js
const { track, awaited } = tracker();

async function f() { await randomDelay(); track('f'); };
async function g() { await randomDelay(); track('g'); };

const pf = f();
const pg = g();

awaited() // []

const ppg = randomDelay().then(async () => { await pg; awaited(); /* ['g'] */});
const ppgf = randomDelay().then(async () => { await pg; await pf; awaited(); /* ['g', 'f'] */});

await pf;

awaited(); // ['f']

await pg;

awaited(); // ['f', 'g']

// further awaits of ppg/ppgf here will not change the result.
```

Notice that `awaited()` above can return any combination of `'f'` and/or `'g'`
in different orders: depending purely on the order they were awaited,
rather than the order the `track` calls were actually run!

This might feel a bit weird at first, but it is _stable_, as the composition/order of the `awaited()`
values will be based only on the (stable) lexical shape of the code, rather than the
unstable order of execution.

In tests, we use this to track assignments to a global environment value.
We also track dependent requests that might be executed via script helpers to
surface dependent requests in `favor`.

## How this Tracks

The tracked values are stored in nodes of an execution graph maintained
with the `async_hooks` API NodeJS offers but tells us not to use.

The nodes of the execution graph have two links:
- the `init` link is for the context in which the promise is created, and
- the `trigger` link is to the promise that preceeds the execution.

The creation of this a node looks something like this:

```ts ins="promise" del=/trigger(?=[.])/
function init(trigger: Promise<unknown>) {
  return promise = trigger.then(() => { ... });
}
```

Note that `trigger` is in general a still-pending operation,
(as is `promise`, of course), while `init` is the context when
the `promise` was created, so awaiting the promise will include
tracked values from inside `init` (and wherever the function was called),
and then the values that were tracked in the course of whatever `trigger`
is waiting for.

Calling `awaited()` collects tracked values by searching this graph.

:::caution
Another leak in the abstraction is that `async function`s are
not run entirely async.

In the following kind of case:
```js
async function hello() { 
  track('world');
  ...
}

hello(); // not awaited

awaited(); // ['world']
```

Calling `hello()` results in the `'world'` value being tracked, without awaiting the promise,
because NodeJS runs the body of an `async` function synchronously
as far as it can.  (Similarly `new Promise(() => { ... })`
executes synchronously as well, while
`Promise.resolve().then(() => { ... })` is executed asynchronously).
:::

## Garbage

Like all non-trivial abstractions, this one leaks: Memory.

The awaited values _are_ garbage-collected along with promises, as much as possible,
but  we have two helpers to cut the graph for correctness and
better garbage collection, respectively.

 - `shared(() => { ... })` drops awaited values going into the execution of `...`.
 - `disconnected(() => { ... })` drops awaited values leaving the execution of `...`.

Both of these methods asynchronosuly start executing their function and
return a promise for its result.

### Shared Execution

`shared` should be used to wrap the creation of promises that are
reused.  

Consider the following,...
```js
function getAuthToken() { 
  return authTokenPromise ??= fetchAuthToken();
}
```
in this case the `authTokenPromise` will inherit the tracked values
leading to the first call of `fetchAuthToken()` only.  This introduces
a race condition as the tracked results of `getAuthToken()` would
depend on who called it first.  Additionally the `fetchAuthToken()` function
would have access to the `awaited()` values of its first caller.

To fix this, we use `shared` to disconnect the execution graph leading into the call.

```js
function getAuthToken() { 
  return authTokenPromise ??= shared(() => fetchAuthToken());
}
```

Inside `fetchAuthToken()` the `awaited()` list will be clear.
Any values tracked inside `fetchAuthToken()` can still be awaited from the `authTokenPromise`.

### Disconnected Execution

The `disconnected` helper does the opposite: it prevents awaited values
from escaping the `disconnected(() => { ... })` boundary. This is meant
to be more of a garbage-collector hint than a behavioral mechanism.

For instance, when running hundreds of test cases we don't want the 
async graphs to pile up in memory, and `disconnected` applied to
the right places does the trick here.
