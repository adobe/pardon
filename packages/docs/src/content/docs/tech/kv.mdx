import { KvPlayground } from '@components';

The KV format is a key-value text format that's basically JSON without the JavaScript compatibility.

In the KV format a KV _value_ can be

- the keywords `true`, `false` or `null`,
- a simple value like `hello`, or a quoted string like `"hello"` or `'world'`.
- a number.
- an array, starting with `[` and ending with `]`, with a series of comma-separated values (trailing comma allowed).
- an object, starting with `{` and ending with `}`, with a series of `key=value` fields (key can be a quoted string).  (For compatibility with javascript, `key:value` is also allowed).

A "simple key" is a key which does not need quoting, which means a non-empty key consisting of 
at most letters, numbers, periods, hyphens.  A simple value can also include slashes.

Key-value data is a sequence of (simple key) `key=value` pairs, terminated by anything
that doesn't match the format.

```text
a=b
c=d
GET ... # since GET doesn't end with an =, we know it's not part of the KV data.
```

This format is accepted at the top of any pardon `.http` template and allows
us to specify values directly in-line with the request.

The main advantages of the KV format are

- less syntax than JSON (quotes can often be elided)
- trailing commas
- using `=` inside objects so that object contents can be
  copied to the top level.

{/*
# TODO: rewrite kv-fmt.ts so that the following is also supported.

a=b
list=[1, 2, 3] # maybe even allow for list=[1 2 3] for lists of values?
things=[
  name=x p=q, # an array element starting with k=v implies a object
  a=b c=d # also note no commas between fields here.
]
*/}
