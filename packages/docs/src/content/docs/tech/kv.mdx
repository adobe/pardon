import { KvPlayground } from '@components';

The KV format is a key-value text format that's basically JSON without the JavaScript compatibility.

KV data consists of zero or more "`{key}={value}`" entries.

Values in KV are
- the keywords `true`, `false` or `null`,
- a JSON-compatible double quoted string, or a single quoted one.
- a JSON number.
- a value which can contain almost anything but spaces or delimiting characters like brackets `[]`, braces `{}`, or commas `,`.
- an array, starting with `[` and ending with `]`, with a series of values separated by whitespace and maybe a comma.
- an object, starting with `{` and ending with `}`, with a series of `key=value` and/or `key: value` fields separated by whitespace and maybe a comma.

Delimiters in KV are whitespace (spaces,tabs,newlines), brackets (`[]`), braces (`{}`) and commas (`,`).
The equals (`=`) and colon (`:`) characters are sometimes-delimiters, they can appear on the value side but cannot appear
in unquoted keys.

Most URLs can be represented unquoted in KV.  Where keys are allowed, quoted strings can be used to include
characters.

For example, `kv` values can preceed an HTTP request because `GET` is not followed by `=`.

```text /.=./
a=b
c=d
GET https://example.com
```

This format is accepted at the top of any pardon `.http` template and allows
us to specify values directly above the request without additional syntax.

The main advantages of the KV format are

- less syntax than JSON (quotes / commas can be elided in many cases).
- Human readable - easy to read and write.
- JSON compatible values - easy to generate

#### KV Playground

Try experimenting here

<KvPlayground kv={/* nb, mdx removes first 2 leading spaces */`
  a=b
  url=http://a.com?q=true

  json_list=[1, 2, 3]
  kv_list = [1 2 3]

  json_obj = { "p": q, "r": s }
  kv_obj={ p=q r=s }
`}/>
