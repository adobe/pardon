import { KvPlayground } from '@components';

The KV format is a key-value text format that's a reduced version of JSON.

KV usually consists of zero or more "`{key}={value}`" entries, where value is in a relaxed JSON format:
- values can be the keywords `true`, `false` or `null`,
- most other strings can be left unquoted (without spaces or KV delimiters, which are commas, colons, equals signs,
  or `[]` and `{}` characters).  Both single and double quotes are supported.
- colons and equals signs are even allowed in unquoted strings in a value context.
- colon as the field/value separator in objects can be (and this is encouraged) replaced by `=`.
- and and all commas are optional, and trailing commas are supported (but repeated commas are not allowed).
- trailing commas are supported.

KV is designed to terminate parsing when non-KV data follows it.
For example, `kv` values can preceed an HTTP request because `GET` is not followed by `=`.

```text /.=./
a=b
c=d
GET https://example.com
```

This format is accepted at the top of any pardon `.http` template and allows
us to specify values directly above the request without additional syntax.

:::tip
In the case that the text following KV data is KV-compatible, the `-*-` sigil
will terminate the KV data. For example
```
a=b
-*-
c=d
```
parses as `{ "a": "b" }` as KV data followed by `c=d` as text.
:::

The main advantages of the KV format are

- less syntax than JSON (quotes can be elided in many cases, commas in all cases).
- Human readable - easy to read and write.
- JSON compatible values - easy to generate

#### KV Playground

Try experimenting here

<KvPlayground kv={/* nb, mdx removes first 2 leading spaces */`
  a=b
  url=http://a.com?q=true

  json_list=[1, 2, 3]
  kv_list = [1 2 3]
  commas = [1,2,3,4,]

  json_obj = { "p": q, "r": "s" }
  kv_obj={ p=q r=s }

  keywords=[null true false]
  text=["null" "true" "false"]

  GET https://hello.example.com/
`}/>
