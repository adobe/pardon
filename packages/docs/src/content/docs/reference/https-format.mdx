## The Https format

Pardon's introduces a new format for describing and recording HTTP calls.

The overall syntax is an optional yaml header followed by a sequence of
requests and responses delimited by lines starting with `>>>` and `<<<` respectively.

Requests look like (optional) KV data, a request starting with an HTTP method and a URL (the
url may be line-broken before `/`, `?` and `&` characters, since headers should not start with these
characters.)  Followed by headers, a blank line, and a body.

Responses are similar but instead of the HTTP method and URL, they have a response code and
(optional) status text.

The semantics of these files is determined by their sub-extension:

<FileTree>
- endpoint.https is a collection https file, used as a template to match a single request and response.
- mixin.mix.https is a mixin template meant to extend a collection https file.
- muxin.mux.https is a mixin template meant to further parameterized a collection https file with a semi-concrete request.
- sequence.flow.https is a program: executing a sequence of requests one-at-a-time.
- sequence.unit.https is also a program, but the results are cached.
- previous.log.https is a record of previous requests and their responses.
</FileTree>

### Endpoints and Mixins

Endpoints and mixins are evaluated till first-match.  Pardon attempts to find the first match
of an endpoint against a request, discarding request and response templates along the way.
Once the first request tempalte is matched, other request options are discarded but 
all remaining response templates are available to process the response (per environment/mixin).

The response is evaluated through a schema created by the first remaining response template
from the endpoint and the first match from each of the active mixins.

Responses can have statuses written as `5xx` or `5**` to indicate any 500-series status code, similarly
`2xx` works as well to cover 200-series responses.

This is how endpoints represent the alternatives of a single request/response interaction.

### Units and Flows

Units and flows (sequences) are executed by the test case-runner.
These are structured in groupos of request and responses for that group.

In sequences, requests and responses are named and a response matching a request name
works like a "goto".

### Logs

Logs are simply pairs of requests and their corresponding responses.  We can use these to
replay requests and maybe compare responses.
