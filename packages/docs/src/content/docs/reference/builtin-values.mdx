## Built-in Values

### HTTP Requests
HTTP requests are parsed and matched with a base template.
The base template defines the following variables:

<div class="[&_td]:first-of-type:whitespace-nowrap">
| Variable | Note |
| --- | --- |
| `method` | The http request method, e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` |
| `origin` | The request origin, including the schema and domain |
| `pathname` | The request path, up to the `?search` part |
| `search` | The request search params, as an object largely compatible with `URLSearchParams` |
| `headers` | The request headers, as an object largely compatible with `Headers` |
| `body` | The request body, usually as a `string`. |
</div>

In the templates, `ANY https://....` declares a request with no request method (which matches any),
and `ANY //` can be used to define a request with no origin to match anything.  These forms are useful
for writing mixin requests.

In the pathname, `{{variable}}` will have a default regex of `/[^/]+/`, i.e., one or more non-slash characters,
while the hint `...` as in `{{...variable}}` matches `/.*/` (anything).

Similarly, in the origin, `{{variable}}` matches `/[^.]+/` (one or more non-dots), and `{{...variable}}` matches `/.*/` (anything).

### HTTP Responses
HTTP responses are parsed and matched with a base template.
The base template defines the following variables:

<div class="[&_td]:first-of-type:whitespace-nowrap">
| Variable | Note |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | The response status |
| `headers` | The response headers, as an object largely compatible with `Headers` |
| `body` | The response body, usually as a `string`. |
</div>
